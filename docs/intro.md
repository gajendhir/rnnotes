# Introduction

## Objective

This site is to document my experiences and also to share the issues faced during the journey of using **[React-Native](https://reactnative.dev)** to successfully create visually stimulating apps.

This documentation site started as an exercise to prepare a sort-of check-list of some of the tasks we have to carry out...
* to *assemble* and *build* *release* and *debug* versions of the apps.
* to *upgrade* react-native, especially for existing apps.
* to *select* from the huge collection of react-native packages from the web.
* to *use* and *customize* react-native packages.
* to *manage* the upgrade related issues of some of the popular packages.

The idea of putting this up as a web-site is my way of *thanking* the **open-source community**. I hope this tiny contribution of mine help will make lives of others simple.

## My Background

I am a computer consultant and lead a small team of software developers. We develop integrated software solutions for our clients. Traditionally, it used LAN based solutions working through all the data handling requirement of the organization. Most of our work used to be done in dotnet with sql-server as the backend. 

Times are changing and things are evolving. Now some of our solutions include mobile apps which frees the executives from the desktop. The data-entry operators were now able to capture data, at the very site where it is generated, in real-time.

**Android** was the default choice because of its easier and cheaper availability compared to *IOS*.

### How I got into React-Native?

We started Android development on the Ecllipse editor and migrated to [Android Studio](http://[develop.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio)) when it was launched. We are still using Android Studio to maintain our existing apps.

All this time, gradually graduated to developing for the web also. HTML, Javascript and allied web technologies like CSS, JQuery made in-roads. Then came along [React](https://reactjs.com), which we were finding interesting - but have not yet used on any project for any client so far. 

Finally, we were practically forced towards [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev) by a client who insisted on giving us the assignment only if we would do it in React-Native. *Today, we humbly thank him for his insistence that we got introduced to this.* Now-a-days, all new Android apps by us are being developed in React-Native.

*We took up the challenge.*

### React Native

In less than a year, React-Native became our preferred choice for app development. All our app development work has targeted the Android ecosystem, but we look forward to release apps for the IOS also, in the near future.

React-native is an evolving technology maintained and promoted by **Meta** - the same group that owns the popular *FaceBook*, *Instagram* and *WhatsApp*. 

It allows us to write apps, in **Javascript**, that can be built into native apps to run on Android and IOS platforms. Today, communities are working on libraries and package that will allow us to build the same apps for - Windows, Macintosh and the Web.

*You write once and use on everywhere*.
