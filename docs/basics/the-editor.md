# Editor and Extensions

## Visual Studio Code

There are a host of configurable editors out there. For me, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft was the clear winner.

It is highly customizable with a plethora of extensions which make it very friendly, powerful and alive. I like the way the editor responds to different parts of the code and errors / mistakes.

I use Visual Studio Code (a.k.a. VSCode or Code) for editing and testing all my Javascript, Python, JSON, React and React-Native code.

## Extensions for React-Native

VSCode was created with extensibility in mind and almost every part of it can be customized. Plenty of extensions are available that enable linting and debugging of react-native codes.

I have installed some extensions to make working with react-native easier...

* **React Native Tools** by Microsoft
* **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** by dsznajder
* **ESLint** by Microsoft
* **Auto Complete Tag** by Jun Han

Some other extension that I have on my VS Code are...

* **vscode-icons** by VSCode Icons Team
* **Color Highlight** by Sergii N

For, my Python projects I have...

* **Python** from Microsoft
* **Pylance** from Microsoft

There is a huge list of extensions to select from. If you are up to it, VSCode comes with an [Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api), that you can use to create your own extension.
