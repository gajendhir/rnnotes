# Editor and Extensions

## Visual Studio Code

There are a host of configurable editors out there. For me, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft was the clear winner.

It is highly customizable with a plethora of extensions which make it very friendly, powerful and alive. I like the way the editor responds to different parts of the code and errors / mistakes.

I use Visual Studio Code (a.k.a. VSCode or Code) for editing and testing all my Javascript, Python, JSON, React and React-Native code.

## Extensions for React-Native

VSCode was created with extensibility in mind and almost every part of it can be customized. Plenty of extensions are available that enable linting and debugging of react-native codes.

I have installed some extensions to make working with react-native easier...

* React Native Tools by Microsoft
* ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets by dsznajder
* ESLint by Microsoft
* Auto Complete Tag by Jun Han

Some other extension that I generally have added to my VS Code are...

* Material Icon Theme
